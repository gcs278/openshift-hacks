Env Variables:
ISTIO_HOST_NETWORKING: If true, then Istio API will use host networking
GW_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT: If true, then a single deployment will be created by these scrpits instead of allowing istiod to auto create it. This changes the architecture from one-to-one gateway to deployment to many-to-one gateways to our manual deployment. This is more aligned with openshift-router architecture.
GW_HOST_NETWORKING: If true, then Gateway API implementation will use host networking. Requires GW_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT
